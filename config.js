        content: "Boruto, feeling overshadowed by his father's accomplishments and the expectations placed on him, initially resents Naruto's dedication to his Hokage duties, believing it causes neglect of their family. This familial tension drives Boruto's early development and motivations. He seeks to establish his identity, separate from his father's, while navigating the trials of being a young ninja in a peaceful but evolving world."

    {
        id: 6,
